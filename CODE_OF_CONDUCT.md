# Code of Conduct

This project aims to provide a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone who participates.

## Our standards

We expect participants to be respectful, constructive, and collaborative. Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful, constructive, and collaborative
- Giving and receiving feedback thoughtfully and assuming good faith while remaining accountable
- Being mindful of different experience levels and backgrounds
- Focusing on what is best for the community and users
- Being open to new technologies, ideas and ways of programming

We do not tolerate harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary behavior. This includes, but is not limited to, behaviors based on protected characteristics such as age, disability, gender identity or expression, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or socio‑economic status.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
- Publishing someone else's private information ("doxxing")
- Sexualized language or imagery, or unwanted sexual attention
- Threats of violence or encouragement of self-harm

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, mailing lists, chat channels, and any other community venues used by this project.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as possible. We will treat reports confidentially to the extent practicable.

Preferred: email the maintainer at <ajimaru_gdr@pm.me>

Alternative: open a GitHub issue and request a private follow-up, or contact any other project maintainer listed in the repository.

If you would prefer to report anonymously, indicate that in your report; we will still attempt to investigate while protecting your privacy.

Please include as much relevant information as possible (what happened, where, when, and any screenshots/logs if applicable). We will acknowledge receipt of reports within 3 business days and aim to follow up about next steps promptly.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers will respond to reported concerns in a fair and timely manner. Possible responses include:

- Request for more information
- Private warning to the offender
- Temporary or permanent removal from project spaces
- Any other action deemed appropriate by the maintainers

We strive to be transparent where possible, but will protect reporter confidentiality. Retaliation against anyone who reports a concern in good faith will not be tolerated.
