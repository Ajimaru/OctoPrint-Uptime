# Code of Conduct

This project aims to provide a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone who participates.

## Our standards

We expect participants to be respectful, constructive, and collaborative. Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful, constructive, and collaborative
- Giving and receiving feedback thoughtfully and assuming good faith while remaining accountable
- Being mindful of different experience levels and backgrounds
- Focusing on what is best for the community and users
- Being open to new technologies, ideas and ways of programming

We do not tolerate harassment, discrimination, or exclusionary behavior. This includes, but is not limited to, behaviors based on protected characteristics such as age, disability, gender identity or expression, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or socio-economic status.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments
- Publishing someone else's private information ("doxxing")
- Sexualized language or imagery, or unwanted sexual attention
- Threats of violence or encouragement of self-harm

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, mailing lists, chat channels, and any other community venues used by this project.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it as soon as possible. We will treat reports confidentially to the extent practicable.

Preferred: email the maintainer at ajimaru_gdr [at] pm [dot] me

Alternative: for non-sensitive concerns, open a GitHub issue and request a private follow-up. For sensitive matters, contact any other project maintainer listed in the repository directly.

If your report involves a listed maintainer, use an alternative reporting channel or escalate to a neutral authority (for example a project sponsor, steering committee, or parent organization); conflicts of interest will be handled by routing the report to that alternate authority to ensure an impartial investigation. If no such authority exists, contact the repository hosting platform's abuse/reporting team (e.g., GitHub support) or seek assistance from an independent third-party mediator or trusted external contributor to facilitate a fair resolution.

If you would prefer to report anonymously, you may use an anonymous online form, a throwaway email address, or explicitly state "I wish to remain anonymous" in your submission; we will still attempt to investigate while protecting your privacy. Providing an optional method for follow-up (such as a temporary contact channel) helps us investigate more effectively while ensuring your identity is kept confidential.

Please include as much relevant information as possible (what happened, where, when, and any screenshots/logs if applicable).

## Enforcement

Project maintainers will respond to reported concerns in a fair and timely manner. Possible responses include:

- Request for more information
- Private warning to the offender
- Temporary or permanent removal from project spaces
- Any other action deemed appropriate by the maintainers

If you are subject to an enforcement action, you may request a review by contacting the maintainers at the address listed in the Reporting section. Appeals will be considered for new information or procedural concerns and handled in a fair and timely manner while preserving reporter confidentiality.

We strive to be transparent where possible, but will protect reporter confidentiality. Retaliation against anyone who reports a concern in good faith will not be tolerated.
