# Classes (auto)

This diagram markdown file is auto-generated from the plugin source using `pyreverse`.

The actual SVG diagram (`classes.svg`) is generated during the CI/documentation build process and not committed to the repository.

For local regeneration instructions, see [REGENERATE.md](./REGENERATE.md).
