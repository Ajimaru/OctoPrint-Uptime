# Pre-commit hook: keep translation catalogs in sync, automatically.
#
# Behavior:
#  - Runs .development/compile_translations.sh, which re-extracts the POT from
#    the current sources, updates the PO files (with --no-fuzzy-matching),
#    compiles the MO files, copies them into the plugin package, and verifies
#    the catalogs (fails on stray fuzzy entries or an 'en' msgstr that differs
#    from its msgid).
#  - Compares the regenerated catalogs against the staged/working versions
#    using a NORMALIZED comparison (volatile POT-Creation-Date / Generated-By
#    headers and shifting "#: file:line" references are ignored). Only a real
#    change in msgids/msgstrs counts.
#  - On a real content change, the hook re-stages the changed translation
#    files and FAILS once (standard pre-commit auto-fixer convention, like
#    black/prettier): the fix is staged for you, just re-run `git commit`.
#  - If only volatile metadata changed, the working tree is restored to avoid
#    noisy timestamp-only diffs, and the commit proceeds.
#  - If the compile/verify step itself fails, the hook fails with that error.
#
# This catches the case where a formatter (djlint/prettier) reflows templates:
# msgid text is unchanged but POT line references move, so the catalogs must be
# regenerated to stay technically in sync without producing churn.

Translation catalogs were out of sync and have been regenerated and staged.
This is expected after editing translatable strings or reformatting templates.
Please re-run your commit to include the updated catalogs.
