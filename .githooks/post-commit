# Description: Minimal git post-commit hook placeholder.
# Behavior:
#  - Ensures the script is running as a Git hook (GIT_DIR set) and that the repo root
#    can be determined; otherwise exits quietly to avoid blocking commits.
#  - Currently a no-op by default but keeps a repository-local hook file available
#    for future post-commit actions such as building distribution artifacts.
# Usage:
#  - Placed in `.githooks/post-commit` and activated via `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.

# No post-commit actions configured; exit silently.
